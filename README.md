# WebTools Kanban

A modern, responsive Kanban board implementation featuring drag-and-drop functionality, dark mode support, and REST API persistence.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure user accounts with Login, Signup, and session persistence.
- **Password Reset**: "Forgot password?" on the sign-in screen emails a reset link (Turnstile-protected); the link opens `reset-password.html`, where the user chooses a new password.
- **Change Password**: Signed-in users can change their password from the profile menu (current password + new password, min. 8 characters).
- **User Profile**: Personalized experience with display names and avatars.
- **Multi-Board Support**: Create, rename, and switch between multiple Kanban boards.
- **Collaborative Access**: Invite members to boards with role-based permissions (Owner, Editor, Viewer).
- **Drag and Drop**: Easily move cards between columns using SortableJS (available for Owners and Editors).
- **Dark Mode**: Seamlessly switch between light and dark themes.
- **REST API**: Your boards and cards are persisted in a PostgreSQL database via a REST API.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Card Management**: Add, edit, and delete cards with priority levels, due dates, custom labels, and rich-text (WYSIWYG) descriptions.
- **Rich-Text Comments**: Card comments support the same WYSIWYG formatting (bold, lists, links, code blocks, etc.) as descriptions.
- **Column Management**: Create new columns, rename existing ones, and delete columns with an integrated card transfer mechanism to prevent data loss.
- **Optimistic UI**: Instant visual feedback for actions like moving cards, with background synchronization to the API.
- **Bot Protection**: Integration with Cloudflare Turnstile to secure Login and Signup forms against automated attacks.
- **Data Portability**: Export your entire board state to a JSON file and import it back to restore your data or move it between browsers.
- **Search Function**: Quickly filter cards across all columns by keyword (title, description, or labels).

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN)
- **JavaScript (ES6 Modules)**
- **SortableJS** (for drag-and-drop)
- **Quill** (WYSIWYG rich-text editor for card descriptions and comments)
- **DOMPurify** (sanitizes rich-text HTML before it's rendered)
- **Cloudflare Turnstile** (for bot protection)

## Rich Text (WYSIWYG)

Card descriptions and comments are edited with a [Quill](https://quilljs.com/) editor (bold,
italic, underline, strike, ordered/unordered lists, blockquote, inline code, code block, and
links). `src/js/editor.js` is the only module that talks to Quill/DOMPurify directly:

- `createRichEditor()` mounts an editor and returns `getHtml()` / `setHtml()` / `isEmpty()`.
- Saved content is a small, fixed subset of HTML (`normalizeEditorHtml`) — Quill's internal
  markup (e.g. `data-list` attributes, code-block containers) is converted to plain `<ul>/<ol>`
  and `<pre><code>` before it's sent to the API.
- Anything rendered back to the page — descriptions, comments, both from this API and from
  older plain-text data — goes through `toDisplayHtml()`, which runs DOMPurify with a fixed
  allow-list (`p, br, h1-h3, strong/b, em/i, u, s, code, pre, blockquote, ul/ol/li, a`, `href`
  only). Legacy plain-text content (saved before this feature existed) is detected and
  rendered as plain paragraphs rather than raw HTML.
- Card previews, the archived-cards list, and the search box use `toPlainText()`, a flattened,
  tag-free version of the content, so list views never show markup.
- The API itself stores and returns `description`/`content` as opaque strings — it does not
  know or care whether they're HTML. All sanitization happens client-side, at render time, so
  it stays effective even if the HTML in storage is ever edited directly or written by another
  client (see the backend's `CLAUDE.md`/`README.md` for the storage side of this).

## Getting Started

No installation or build process is required. Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to start using the board.

## Development

This is a vanilla JavaScript project. Since it uses ES6 modules and CDN-hosted dependencies, it can be run directly from the filesystem or a simple local server.

- **Styling**: All layouts are built with Tailwind CSS.
- **State**: The application state is maintained as a central object and synchronized with a REST API.
- **Interactions**: UI events are handled via a mix of direct listeners and custom browser events.
